# Limitations of Meta's Robyn Marketing Mix Modelling Framework

Meta's Robyn Marketing Mix Modelling (MMM) framework is a widely adopted tool for optimising marketing spend across various channels. While it offers innovative features and has gained popularity for its open-source availability, Robyn’s methodological underpinnings are fundamentally flawed in several critical areas. These limitations include the problematic use of constrained penalised regression, the reliance on transformations such as adstock and saturation, the inappropriate use of cross-validation in small samples, and the broader consequences of its high computational demands and black-box nature. This paper provides an in-depth critique of Robyn, highlighting its theoretical, computational, and practical deficiencies.

## Overparameterisation and Model Instability

At the core of Robyn’s framework is a constrained penalised regression, which applies ridge regularisation alongside additional constraints, such as enforcing positive intercepts or directional constraints on certain coefficients based on marketing theory. While these constraints aim to align the model’s outputs with theoretical expectations, they exacerbate the inherent limitations of regularisation in finite-sample settings. This regression is also subject to non-linear transforms, to fulfil certain marketing assumptions.

Robyn’s parameter space is particularly problematic. In typical applications, datasets often consist of \( t \approx 100-150 \) observations (e.g., two years of weekly data) and \( p \approx 45 \) parameters (e.g., dozens of channels, each with multiple transformations). This ratio of parameters to observations approaches or exceeds 1:2, creating a textbook case of overfitting. Ridge regularisation, while intended to shrink coefficients and mitigate overfitting, relies on asymptotic properties that do not hold in such small samples. The additional constraints applied in Robyn intensify the shrinkage effect, further distorting coefficient estimates (\( \hat{\beta} \)) and reducing their interpretability.
Robyn’s design represents a layer cake of methodological problems that render it unsuitable for inference. Its overparameterisation and constrained penalisation lead to unstable and distorted coefficient estimates, while its reliance on inappropriate cross-validation exacerbates these issues, particularly in small samples. The transformations and regularisation strategies employed, though innovative, are poorly adapted to finite-sample settings, creating significant risks of overfitting and unreliable results. Furthermore, the black-box nature of the framework obscures its inner workings, making it difficult to replicate results or draw meaningful conclusions.

Taken together, these flaws highlight that Robyn is not a reliable tool for causal inference or robust decision-making. Its outputs are unstable, non-replicable, and overly sensitive to hyperparameter tuning and data partitioning.

Compounding this issue is the lack of robust model selection criteria. Robyn uses Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to guide model selection, which focuses solely on predictive accuracy without penalising complexity. Unlike established criteria such as AIC or BIC, RMSE fails to account for the trade-off between goodness-of-fit and model parsimony. As a result, Robyn’s models often perform well in-sample but fail to generalise, undermining their utility for robust decision-making.

## The Challenges of Adstock and Saturation Transformations

Robyn incorporates sophisticated transformations to capture the dynamic effects of advertising, including adstock and saturation functions. While these transformations provide flexibility in modelling marketing dynamics, they introduce significant challenges.

### Adstock Transformations
Adstock transformations model the carryover effects of advertising over time. Robyn offers two key variants:

1. **Geometric Adstock**: This is a simple decay model where the impact of advertising diminishes geometrically over time, controlled by a decay parameter (\( \theta \)). While straightforward, this approach assumes a fixed decay rate, which may not capture the nuances of real-world advertising effects. Sadly, the literature on Geometric Adstock is relatively sparse and primarily rooted in older research. The concept of adstock and geometric decay stems from foundational studies in advertising and marketing econometrics dating back to the mid-to-late 20th century. These early works were largely focused on understanding advertising's carryover effects and used simple geometric decay due to its computational simplicity and ease of interpretation.

2. **Weibull Adstock**: This more flexible approach uses the Weibull distribution to model decay, allowing for varying shapes of decay curves. While powerful, the additional parameters increase model complexity and susceptibility to overfitting, particularly in small samples.

### Saturation Transformations
To model diminishing returns on advertising spend, Robyn employs the Michaelis-Menten transformation, a non-linear function that captures saturation effects. While this approach is effective in reflecting diminishing marginal returns, it further complicates model interpretability and increases the risk of mis-specification. The combined use of adstock and saturation transformations leads to a highly parameterised and intricate model that is challenging to validate.

## Cross-Validation in Small Samples

Cross-validation is a cornerstone of Robyn’s methodology, used to validate the robustness of hyperparameter tuning and model selection. However, cross-validation is inherently problematic in the context of small samples and autoregressive processes, such as those generated by adstock transformations. In time-series data, the temporal dependencies between observations violate the assumption of independence required for traditional cross-validation. This leads to over-optimistic performance metrics and undermines the validity of cross-validation as a model validation technique.

Moreover, the choice of folds and splitting strategies significantly impacts results. For example, if folds are not carefully designed to account for temporal ordering, the model may inadvertently use future information to predict past outcomes, creating a form of data leakage. In small samples, the limited number of training and validation splits further amplifies these issues, rendering cross-validation results unreliable and misleading.

## Practical Consequences

### Instability in Coefficient Estimates
Robyn’s overparameterisation and aggressive regularisation result in highly unstable coefficient estimates. This instability makes it difficult to draw reliable conclusions about the effectiveness of individual channels, undermining the model’s credibility for budget allocation and strategic planning.

### Fluctuating ROAS Estimates
Users often report significant variability in Return on Advertising Spend (ROAS) estimates, which can fluctuate dramatically depending on the chosen hyperparameters, transformations, and data partitions. This inconsistency creates challenges for practitioners attempting to derive actionable insights from the model.

### Complexity and Lack of Transparency
Robyn’s black-box nature, with its layered transformations and reliance on evolutionary algorithms for hyperparameter optimisation, obscures the inner workings of the model. This lack of transparency hinders the ability of users to interpret results, communicate insights to stakeholders, and trust the model’s outputs.

## Computational Inefficiencies

Robyn’s reliance on evolutionary algorithms, such as Nevergrad, for hyperparameter optimisation introduces significant computational inefficiencies. These algorithms lack convergence guarantees and often require multiple restarts to achieve stable solutions. The framework’s implementation in R, without parallelisation, further exacerbates runtime issues, making it impractical for large-scale or high-dimensional applications.

## Causal Inference Limitations

Robyn prioritises predictive accuracy over causal interpretability, making it unsuitable for deriving robust causal insights. Temporal dependencies are inadequately addressed, and regularisation techniques distort coefficient estimates, further complicating causal interpretation. Endogeneity issues, such as omitted variable bias, are also unresolved, limiting the reliability of causal inferences drawn from the model.

Is Robyn a good model? What, even, is a good model?

A good model must satisfy two essential criteria: it must be theoretically sound and practically useful. Theoretical soundness ensures that the model adheres to established principles, provides reliable estimates, and is consistent with the underlying data-generating process. Practical usefulness, in the sense articulated by George Box, means the model must be "good enough" to yield actionable insights, even if it is an approximation of reality. These dual criteria establish a balance between rigour and utility, which is critical in applied domains like marketing econometrics.

A theoretically sound model avoids overfitting by maintaining parsimony, incorporates valid identification strategies to separate signal from noise, and provides consistent, unbiased parameter estimates. Additionally, it must account for dependencies in the data, such as temporal autocorrelations, and offer robust uncertainty quantification. Without these elements, a model is fundamentally unreliable, irrespective of its predictive capabilities.

Practical usefulness requires the model to be interpretable, transparent, and scalable to real-world scenarios. Stakeholders need to understand its outputs, trust its insights, and use it effectively to guide decision-making. Models that fail to provide clarity or require excessive computational resources undermine their utility, regardless of their sophistication.

By these standards, Robyn fails on both counts. Its constrained penalised regression introduces bias, distorts parameter estimates, and leads to instability in small samples, violating the criterion of theoretical soundness. Simultaneously, its black-box nature, computational inefficiencies, and hyperparameter sensitivity render it impractical for consistent and reliable decision-making. Robyn exemplifies a model that is neither theoretically sound nor practically useful, falling short of what constitutes a "good" model.
